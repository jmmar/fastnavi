// Submission, fences and the completion thread of the Vulkan back end.
// One timeline semaphore (VkCtx.timeline) orders everything: each submission records its command handles into a
// primary command buffer (vk_exec_record) and signals the next timeline value, which is the NVN fence value
// the front end hands to syncs. The completion thread waits on the timeline and, in submit order, runs the CPU side
// effects queued for each value (event writes, counter reports, sync state), then frees the memory and texture objects whose users
// completed. A value counts as done only after its side effects ran, so a guest woken by fence_wait sees them.
//
// One timeline value per submission, signalled at ALL_COMMANDS; waits use vkWaitSemaphores, and a failed wait is
// treated as a lost device.

// VkSubmitInfo2 each, in the order they were made; a part of a long submission (vk_sync_split) goes at once, with what
// is held before it, since it was split off to start the GPU early. Queue order is what orders them with everything
// else, so held work goes to the queue before anything else does or is waited for:
// - every other submitter, and every idle wait, takes the queue lock through vk_queue_lock, which flushes first;
// - a fence wait for a value still held flushes (fence_wait_impl), as do vk_sync_finish and shutdown;
// - the completion thread flushes what has been held for HOLD_NS, so a guest that polls memory a held submission
//   writes, instead of waiting on its fence, still sees it soon; it only tries the lock, never waits for it.
// H is guarded by the queue lock. NX2NAVI_SUBMIT_BATCH=0 (or 1) hands each to the queue at once; =N holds up to N.
